(BE) Content analysis for accurate file type detection
    Use apache tika or the built in ImageIO libs to accurately determine file type detection. Use this to validate the
    content-type coming from the client, and also to more accurately determine the correct file extension to use.


(FE) Upit Splash Page
    Possibly make this a form that can upload files or paste from the same page? I.e, the google approach.


(FE & BE) Image/Video landing page
    Nice landing page to display images/videos when not accessed via the direct file download link.
    Display the following URL's:

    * Short URL Direct Download Link '/d/3423.png'
    * Long URL Direct Download Link  '/d/3423/foo-image-name.png'
    * SPA URL                        '/#/file/3423'
    * SPA URL                        '/#/file/3423/foo-image-name.png'


(FE) Line highlighting for pasted files


(FE) Diff for pasted files
    The backend already tracks parent pastes when you create a paste from an existing paste. A diff viewer page would be nice.
