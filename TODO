(BE) Shorten Direct Download URL for files
    The direct download link for files uses the full REST api which is pretty long, and will change as the REST API
    changes. The application should instead route a shorter, more standard URL for direct downloads via routing or some
    a dedicated servlet.


(BE) Content analysis for accurate file type detection
    Use apache tika or the built in ImageIO libs to accurately determine file type detection. Use this to validate the
    content-type coming from the client, and also to more accurately determine the correct file extension to use.


(FE) Upit Splash Page
    Possibly make this a form that can upload files or paste from the same page? I.e, the google approach.


(FE) Image/Video landing page
    Nice landing page to display images/videos when not accessed via the direct file download link.


(FE) Line highlighting for pasted files


(FE) Diff for pasted files
    The backend already tracks parent pastes when you create a paste from an existing paste. A diff viewer page would be nice.
